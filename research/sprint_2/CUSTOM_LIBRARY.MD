# Customized Machine Learning Library

## I. Introduction

**Background:**
This research focuses on the development of a custom machine learning library using TensorFlow and PyTorch. It addresses the benefits of the custom library, motivation behind the initiative, discusses the methods for creating such a library, and provides valuable resources for further development.

## II. Research Question

**Question:**
How can a custom machine learning library be designed using TensorFlow and PyTorch to cater to the specific needs of AutoML?

## III. Relevance to the Project

**Objectives:**
1. **Tailored to Your Needs:** One key advantage of creating a custom machine learning library is the ability to optimize it for specific use cases for AutoML.
2. **Custom Algorithms:** We can potentially implement specialized algorithms or model architectures that are not readily available in standard libraries.
3. **Educational Value:** Developing a custom library can be a valuable learning experience. It will help deepen our understanding of machine learning frameworks, algorithms, and best practices.

## IV. Creating Our Custom Library

1. Identify the machine learning models, components, or utilities that the library will support.
2. Design the architecture of the custom library, including the modules, components, and APIs that we need to develop.
3. Begin implementing the library by coding the components, functions, and classes. Consider modular design principles to keep the codebase organized.
4. Implement unit tests, integration tests, and stress tests to identify and fix bugs, errors, or performance issues.
5. If performance optimization is a priority, we can focus on fine-tuning our library for specific hardware configurations, leveraging hardware accelerators (e.g., GPUs), and implementing efficient algorithms.
